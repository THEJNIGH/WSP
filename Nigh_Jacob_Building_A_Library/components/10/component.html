        <h2>Customization</h2>
        <p>Navigating an everyday app should be simple, and that’s why we rethought how students and instructors access the things they use most. They can now rename, hide, reorder, and color-code courses – so they decide what’s most important in the app. With features like favoriting blog posts, folders, and announcements, no one will have to click through a whole course to get to the places they visit most often.</p>
